# Examples
This section contains examples to help you get acquainted with the FEM-Design API via C#, Grasshopper or Python.

The _numbered examples_ are meant to give you an introduction to the API and how to work with it, starting simple in Example 1 and growing in complexity. These examples showcase the same thing for all languages and toolboxes, meaning you can run the same example in C# or Grasshopper and get the same result.

The _Practical examples_ are all meant to showcase different functions, projects and applications of the API. They are not necessarily the same for all languages, unlike the numbered examples. If there is a particular example you'd like to see, please let us know!

## Running the example files

### üë©‚Äçüíª C#
To properly run the C# examples, we recommend that you clone the entirety of the FEM-Design API repository with Git. You can find instructions for this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). You can also download the entire repository as a .zip file and unpack it on your computer.

There are two ways to run the C# examples: either find a specific example in the `femdesign-api/FemDesign.Examples/C#` folder, then open the project file (`.csproj`) found there and run the program. Or, open the main solution (`femdesign-api.sln`) found in the `femdesign-api` folder, and select which of the example projects you want to run. 

### ü¶ó Grasshopper
The Grasshopper examples can be run without cloning the repository - all you need is to install the package, instructions for this can be found on the [main page](https://github.com/strusoft/femdesign-api#-grasshopper). Once installed, you can download any of the files in the `femdesign-api/FemDesign.Examples/Grasshopper` folder and open them in Grasshopper.

The examples are ready to run out-of-the-box, but you might have to set a file path or file name. You'll know either from instructions in the file, or because some components are orange or red.

### ü§ñ Dynamo
With Dynamo installed, any of the Dynamo examples are ready to run. Download an entire example folder and run the - or one of the - `.dyn` files within. Any `.dyf` files are there to define a cluster of components, but as long as they are in the same folder as the `.dyn` files you run, you don't have to touch them.

The examples are ready to run out-of-the-box, but you might have to set a file path or file name. You'll know either from instructions in the file, or because some components give an error.

### üêç Python
`pip install FEM-Design` to install the library and any of the python examples are ready to run.
